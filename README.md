## Assignment 01 - I/O

Use getopt to accept the following optional parameters:

{ head | tail } [OPTION ] . . . [ FILE ]

Print the first | last 10 lines of FILE to standard output  
<br>

Options :

-n K output the first|last K lines

-V Output version info: Your name, email, student number.

-h display and exit ( something like this )

-e|-o print even|odd lines.

The odd and even line printing maybe a little bazaar and generally useless, but it is there to test your programming. If -n 20, then your program should output 20 lines (eg. half of the first|last 40 lines). Number the first line of the file as 1 when calculating odd and even.
